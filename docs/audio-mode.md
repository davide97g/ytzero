# Audio mode

Audio mode replaces the watch-page video player with a compact audio-only
player. It is intended for music, podcasts, long-form videos, and livestreams
that should continue playing while the browser is in the background. On iOS
Safari and other supported mobile browsers, it can continue from the lock
screen and exposes system controls through the Media Session API.

## Using audio mode

Open a video and use the audio/video control near the player controls. To start
a playlist in audio mode, open the arrow menu beside **Play all** or **Continue
watching** and choose the audio-only option; the main part of each button
starts it in video mode. The current playback position is handed to the audio
player when switching from a regular video and handed back when returning to
video. Audio mode participates in the normal progress, completion, playlist,
and continuous-playback flow.

The choice is stored in browser `localStorage`, namespaced by the active
profile. It remains enabled while navigating between videos, including the rest
of a playlist started in audio mode, but only in that browser and for that
profile. It is not a server setting, does not follow the profile to another
device, and is not included in backups.

## Automatic hand-off in the background

**Keep playing in the background (mobile)**, under Settings → Display →
Playback, is disabled by default. When it is enabled, leaving the app or
locking the screen switches a playing video to audio mode, and returning to the
app switches back to the video player at the same position. Both directions
reuse the regular position hand-off, so nothing is re-watched or skipped.

The hand-off only runs on touch devices (`pointer: coarse`): a hidden desktop
tab keeps playing video on its own. It also needs the video to be playing and
audio mode to be available for it; a paused player, a Watch Together session,
or content audio mode does not support is left alone.

Pausing from the lock screen keeps audio mode after returning to the app,
because remounting the video player would start playing again. Use the
audio/video control to go back to video. An automatic hand-off never changes
the remembered per-profile audio-mode choice, and it is forgotten when the
watch page is left or reloaded.

Switching to a new source cannot be gapless: the audio source is resolved when
the hand-off happens, so playback pauses briefly before it resumes. iOS decides
whether a newly mounted element may start while the page is hidden, so the
hand-off can fail there and the first touch after returning restarts audio.

## Requirements and supported content

For videos without a local copy, the YT Zero server must have a working
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installation and Deno 2.3 or newer
available on `PATH`. Deno runs yt-dlp's JavaScript challenge solver for videos
that YouTube does not expose without that step. The official Docker image and
native installer bundle both. A completed download is played directly from the
local file instead, so it does not require yt-dlp or access to YouTube.

Audio mode is available for:

- regular public videos with a compatible AAC audio stream;
- active public livestreams with a compatible HLS audio stream.

It is not available for upcoming, private, members-only, or unavailable videos,
child profiles, or Watch Together sessions. An ended livestream can use the
regular-video path after YouTube publishes a compatible audio format.

## How streaming works

For a completed download, the audio element reads the existing range-capable
`/stream` response directly. It does not request an audio manifest, resolve a
new source, or contact YouTube.

For regular videos without a completed download, yt-dlp resolves an AAC stream
in an MP4 container. When the source publishes an MP4 segment index (`sidx`),
YT Zero exposes its existing fragments as a same-origin HLS VOD playlist. This
lets a seek request the fragment at the target time directly, including in
recordings many hours long. The index and fragments are read through the same
bounded, validated byte-range proxy; there is no transcoding and signed upstream
URLs are never exposed to the browser. Sources without a usable index fall back
to the regular byte-range audio stream.

Safari consumes the VOD playlist through its native HLS support. Other
supported browsers use the same lazily loaded `hls.js` path as live audio. VOD
keeps up to about four minutes ahead of the playhead, while live audio retains
its short buffer so it stays close to the broadcast edge.

For active livestreams, yt-dlp resolves an HLS audio rendition. YT Zero rewrites
the rolling playlist and proxies its manifests and segments through opaque,
same-origin URLs. Redirects between allowed YouTube media hosts are followed
with every hop revalidated against the media-host allowlist.

Resolved sources, parsed VOD indexes, and live sessions are isolated by profile
because yt-dlp may use profile-specific YouTube cookies. They are kept only as
short-lived runtime cache entries and are invalidated when their upstream source
expires, fails, or is explicitly retried.

## Controls and browser behavior

The audio player provides play/pause, seeking for regular videos, elapsed and
remaining time, volume and mute controls, playback speed where applicable, and
live-state presentation for broadcasts. Media Session metadata includes the
video title, channel, and thumbnail.

Background and lock-screen playback ultimately depend on browser and operating
system policy. iOS may still stop playback under memory pressure, after a
network change, or when a live playlist is temporarily unavailable.

When iOS blocks the initial autoplay after navigation, the first touch anywhere
on the watch page retries the audio start. This one-time fallback stops as soon
as the element has started, so a listener's deliberate pause is never undone by
a later touch.

## Errors and retrying

If no compatible source can be resolved, the player displays **Try again**.
Each retry invalidates the previous source instead of reusing a failed cache
entry and asks yt-dlp to resolve it again. After three unsuccessful attempts,
the control is disabled and the player suggests trying again later.

The backend also refreshes the video's current live status after a failed
resolution. This repairs rows imported through channel RSS without a live
marker and automatically changes between progressive and livestream audio when
YouTube reports a different current state.

Useful server log events include:

- `audio.source_attempt_failed` and `audio.source_resolution_failed`;
- `audio.upstream_failed` and `audio.upstream_redirect`;
- `audio.vod_index_ready` and `audio.vod_index_unavailable`;
- `audio.live_status_probe_failed`;
- `video.live_status_corrected`;
- `downloads.ytdlp_js_runtime_missing` when Deno cannot be executed.

These diagnostics contain video/profile identifiers and safe failure reasons,
but do not log signed media URLs or cookie contents.
