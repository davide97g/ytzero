## Privacy

YT Zero does not require a Google account or a YouTube Data API key. It stores app data in the database you control: SQLite by default or PostgreSQL after an explicit migration. The app still connects to YouTube to fetch RSS feeds, metadata, thumbnails, pages, and embedded videos.

Optional automatic update checks contact the GitHub Releases API. The bundled
changelog remains available when checks are disabled or GitHub cannot be
reached.

Watch-page comments are disabled by default. When enabled for a profile, they
are fetched through yt-dlp only after the viewer scrolls to the comments
section. Configured YouTube access cookies may be used for restricted content;
cookie files are per profile, machine-local secrets and never enter portable
backups. Video-info lookups normally remain anonymous. If YouTube refuses the
instance's address, YT Zero may retry that lookup through a configured cookie jar:
it prefers the current profile's jar and otherwise borrows the first configured
profile's jar for interactive and background work. These requests are then
attributable to that jar's YouTube account; the borrowing is recorded in the
server log without exposing cookie contents. Other YouTube page and metadata
requests made in a profile context may also carry that profile's jar. Cookie
rotation returned by those direct responses is merged back into the local jar,
and the Downloads configuration reports whether YouTube still recognizes it.

### DeArrow

The optional [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) integration is disabled by default. Replacement titles and thumbnails can be enabled independently under **Settings → Privacy**.

- For title and branding lookups, the YT Zero server sends only the first four characters of the video's SHA-256 hash to `sponsor.ajay.app`. The response contains a group of possible matches, and YT Zero selects the entry for the requested video locally.
- When a community thumbnail is available and thumbnail replacement is enabled, the image request to `dearrow-thumb.ajay.app` contains the YouTube video ID and selected timestamp.
- Branding lookup results are cached in server memory for 15 minutes. They are not written to the library, and a missing or failed lookup falls back to the original title and thumbnail.
- The switches are portable per-profile preferences. Replacement responses and caches are not included in portable backups.

DeArrow/SponsorBlock community data is available under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

### TubeArchivist

The optional TubeArchivist plugin is disabled by default. When enabled, the YT
Zero server connects to the one administrator-configured TubeArchivist origin
to synchronize its catalog, load archived comments, proxy thumbnails and
subtitles, stream protected media, and optionally mark completed videos
watched. The browser communicates only with YT Zero and never receives the
TubeArchivist API token. Cross-origin redirects are rejected, and the token,
server URL, media locators, synchronized cache, and watched outbox are excluded
from portable backups. See [TubeArchivist Integration](TubeArchivist-Integration)
for the full data flow and security model.

## Limitations

- RSS feeds expose only a limited recent set of videos per channel.
- YouTube page structure can change, which may affect metadata, live detection, Shorts detection, or playlist parsing.
- Embedded playback is still YouTube playback and follows YouTube embed behavior.
- Multi-user support is profile-based on a single self-hosted install, not multi-tenant. Each profile follows channels independently and starts empty; underlying channel/video data is shared and deduplicated across the install for efficiency, but subscriptions and all other state are per-profile.

YT Zero optionally queries the SponsorBlock API to automatically skip segments while watching. SponsorBlock is an open-source project by [Ajay Ramachandran](https://github.com/ajayyy) — thank you to everyone who contributes segments to the database.
