A self-hosted YouTube subscriptions reader with no Google account, no API key, and no recommendation algorithm.

YT Zero reads public YouTube RSS feeds, stores videos in your own SQLite or PostgreSQL database, and gives you a quiet inbox for filtering, scheduling, watching, archiving, and organizing videos from the channels you already care about.
